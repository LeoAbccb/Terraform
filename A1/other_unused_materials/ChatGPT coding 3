>Hello, We are starting to make website by docker and flask with python now.
I also need to make a user login system together with a restaurant login system 
which restaurant login system is a business account, user login system is for normal user. 
Normal user can follow, write review, make booking and order food for restaurant. Business user can setup and update restaurant page and give info.
Also, They can setup and update their restaurant menu. The order and booking system will be shown in their pages, too.
They should be able to setup and update these.
May you give some samples for us detailly?
Thank you very much!

<I can provide you with an outline and some sample code snippets to help you get started with your Docker, Flask, and Python-based website. 
To achieve the desired functionality, you will need to implement user authentication, role-based access control, 
and the necessary CRUD operations for your user and business accounts.

Here's a detailed outline:

1.Set up a Docker container for your Flask application.
2.Create a Flask application with SQLAlchemy for database management.
3.Define User and Restaurant models.
4.Set up user authentication using Flask-Login.
5.Implement role-based access control.
6.Implement CRUD operations for users and restaurants.
7.Create the necessary routes and templates.

1.Setting up a Docker container
Create a Dockerfile in your project's root directory with the following content:

FROM python:3.8-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
Create a requirements.txt file with the necessary dependencies:

Flask==2.0.2
Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.5.1
Flask-Login==0.5.0

2.Creating the Flask application
Create a main.py file with the following content:

from flask import Flask, render_template, redirect, url_for, flash
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_login import LoginManager

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///site.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
login_manager = LoginManager(app)

# Import your routes here
from your_project_package import routes

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
    
3.Defining the User and Restaurant models
Create a models.py file and define the User and Restaurant models:

from flask_login import UserMixin
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
from your_project_package import db, login_manager

class User(db.Model, UserMixin):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(20), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(60), nullable=False)
    role = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)
    restaurants = relationship("Restaurant", backref="owner", lazy=True)

class Restaurant(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    description = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=True)
    owner_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'), nullable=False)
    
4.Setting up user authentication
In your routes.py file, set up the necessary routes for user authentication:

from flask import render_template, redirect, url_for, flash
from flask_login import login_user, logout_user, login_required
from your_project_package.forms import LoginForm, RegistrationForm
from your_project_package.models import User
from your_project_package import app, db, login_manager

@login_manager.user_loader
def load_user(user_id):
    return User.query.get(int(user_id))

@app.route("/login", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def login():
    form = LoginForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        user = User.query.filter_by(email=form.email.data).first()
        if user and user.password == form.password.data:
            login_user(user)
            return redirect(url_for("home"))
        else:
            flash("Login unsuccessful. Please check your email and password.")
    return render_template("login.html", form=form)

@app.route("/logout")
@login_required
def logout():
    logout_user()
    return redirect(url_for("home"))

@app.route("/register", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def register():
    form = RegistrationForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        user = User(username=form.username.data, email=form.email.data, password=form.password.data, role=form.role.data)
        db.session.add(user)
        db.session.commit()
        flash("Account created successfully")
        return redirect(url_for("login"))
    return render_template("register.html", form=form)
    
5. Implementing role-based access control
Update your User model to include a has_role method:

class User(db.Model, UserMixin):
    # ...
    def has_role(self, role):
        return self.role == role
        
6.CRUD operations for users and restaurants
You will need to create the necessary routes and templates to handle user and restaurant CRUD operations. 
This will include routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting restaurants,
as well as the ability for users to follow,write reviews, make bookings, and order food.

Here's an example of the route for creating a new restaurant:

from your_project_package.forms import CreateRestaurantForm
from your_project_package.models import Restaurant

@app.route("/create_restaurant", methods=["GET", "POST"])
@login_required
def create_restaurant():
    if not current_user.has_role("business"):
        flash("You don't have permission to access this page.")
        return redirect(url_for("home"))
        
    form = CreateRestaurantForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        restaurant = Restaurant(name=form.name.data,
                                description=form.description.data,
                                owner_id=current_user.id)
        db.session.add(restaurant)
        db.session.commit()
        flash("Restaurant created!")
        return redirect(url_for("home"))
    return render_template("create_restaurant.html", form=form)

7.Creating the necessary routes and templates
Finally, you will need to create templates for each of the routes, such as login.html, register.html, create_restaurant.html, and so on. 
You can use the render_template function to render these templates and pass in the necessary data.

Here's an example of a simple login.html template:

{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block content %}
  <h2>Login</h2>
  <form method="POST" action="{{ url_for('login') }}">
    {{ form.csrf_token }}
    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="email">Email</label>
      {{ form.email(class="form-control") }}
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="password">Password</label>
      {{ form.password(class="form-control") }}
    </div>
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Login</button>
  </form>
{% endblock %}

<Following this outline and implementing the necessary routes and templates, you should be able to create a functional website with user and restaurant login systems,
as well as the desired features for normal users and business users.

Remember to adjust your imports in the example code snippets based on your project's package and file structure.
